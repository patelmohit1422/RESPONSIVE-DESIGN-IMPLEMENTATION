For Task 2 of the Codetech Internship, I was required to create 3 to 5 web or app screens using a consistent design system. While I had the option to use Google‚Äôs Material Design or Apple‚Äôs Human Interface Guidelines, I decided to challenge myself and build a custom design system specifically for a fictitious interior design and architecture studio.

The aim was to create a clean, elegant, and responsive website that showcased services, team members, and contact options ‚Äî all with consistent UI elements, spacing, color themes, and typography.

**üìê Custom Design System Overview**
I created a modular design system centered around:

- Typography: I used Google Fonts including Josefin Slab for headings, Muli for body text, and Baloo Da for Hindi-inspired artistic styling in key areas.

- Colors: A clean monochrome palette was chosen with golden-yellow highlights (#f9a826) to emphasize call-to-actions and buttons.

- Layout: Each section was structured with generous padding, visual hierarchy, and consistent alignment.

- Icons: FontAwesome was used to maintain icon consistency throughout sections.

- Components: Buttons, cards, headers, social icons, and forms followed a consistent size, border-radius, and margin system.

**üíª Responsiveness & Interactions**
- The entire site is fully responsive using media queries and flexible layouts.

- JavaScript handles:

  - Preloader animation using setTimeout

  - Hamburger menu toggle for navigation on mobile

  - Scroll-to-top button with smooth scroll behavior

  - Interactive card tilting using tilt.js for hover feedback
